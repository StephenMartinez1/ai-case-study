 


Typeface AI - Anything Imagined 

    Typeface was incorporated in May 2022 by Abhay Parasnis, a former executive at Adobe. During an interview with Techcrunch in June 2023,Abhay shares his experience of how his love for photography synergized with his work at Adobe, and the idea for a new company was a challenge he wanted to take on. 
        “Every part of the enterprise needs compelling, personalized content to drive results, and that too, more at a rapid pace,” he said. “Typeface revolutionizes the way enterprises deliver content, empowering every facet of the organization to drive exceptional results with unprecedented speed.” 
    Typeface has established partnerships with several major technology companies such as Salesforce, Invidia, Microsoft, Google Cloud, etc. The company has also many private investors who have injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the startup. As of June 2023, Typeface has raised over $100M from supporters and is evaluated at over $1B. 

    Typeface uses AI to overcome and simplify the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of traditional font design.  Their AI algorithms aid in generation and manipulation of letterforms in a more intuitive and adaptive manner. Designers and creators, both professional and personal, would benefit from using Typeface. Since Typeface can be used in every industry to create and improve fonts and visuals for their brands.  Typeface wants to help personalize branding for each customer. Typeface is one of the first to specifically address this type of market with generative AI.  Simplicity and the desire to help new and existing companies is one of the advantages they utilize. The company has experienced executive leadership with many years of experience in Fortune 500 tech companies. Typeface uses enterprise-grade generative AI, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Human-Computer Interaction, Cloud Computing, all major Technolgies used to support its daily business.  Typeface empowers designers with innovative tools for font design, enabling them to leverage AI-driven capabilities while maintaining creative control and flexibility in the design process 

    Typeface specializes font and graphical design for companies of all sizes. With so many companies starting in the past 4 years, all of them, regardless of industry, have to create and advertise their brand/products.  This is a one for one requirement when creating any company, so the need has always been there.  More and more with technology advancing as quickly as it has been, using AI to help simplify common tasks is invaluable. Other major companies in this field that are alternatives to Typeface are:

    Typeface has enabled graphic design studios to significantly streamline their font design process.  The AI powered capabilities have expanded creative possibilities for designers. Companies that adopt Typeface gain competitive advantages in the market vs traditional means.  Typeface has been transformative for the design industry and will continue to evolve as more users use the AI. Time is an expensive cost for any company. Companies in this field will be able to more rapidly complete the design process while also potentially benefiting from additional inspiration and creativity using Typeface. The faster a task can be completed without additional risk to quality is always sought after.  Tasks, especially unique creative ones customized for specific customers/products, are hard to standardize.  As such, understanding the time it might take varies wildly.  My company relies on standardization of tasks that can be accomplished following a very detailed process.  These processes have times associated with each sub-process so that performance can be measured very accurately.  My company is performing at the top of its industry, which it has for many years.  This is somewhat due to very few competitors and/or many major programs working in partnership with competitors.  Military government funded companies have special treatment and are hard to compare to other non-military government funded companies. 

    I believe that even with all the technology, a human touch will always be required and desired to some degree.  As such, I would advise my company to integrate policy where aging workforce would be retrained and exposed to new emerging technology that will be implemented in the near future impacting their routine. Currently, the aging workforce is reluctant to change.  Many have been doing the same jobs, the same way, for 20years+.  These tasks are very manual and have a variety of outcomes depending on the individual.  Even though processes are constantly being improved, requirements for accuracy and tightening of schedules from customers are impacting production ever more. Unfortunately, due to the type of work we do, we are very limited in the type of technology we can use at the production level.  There is a whole division whose purpose is to go out and find technology that we might be able to benefit from, vet them, create a use, then modify to fit our need.  I am on a different team that uses only existing approved technology and identifies ways to utilize them on current tasks. This new policy would utilize a phased implementation approach using current available/approved technology.  Engineers would perform time studies and review historical data of what tasks could have the highest potential improvement to both quality and touch-time.  The Human-Factor is important as the workforce would be encouraged to share their many years of experience to provide additional firsthand information that might not be identified by Engineers who have never performed the set of tasks and are only going based off data and processes.  Sometimes goals of cost reduction, which include the time it takes to complete a task and ensuring that the required level of quality is met, are achievable by minor tweaks and do not require the latest and greatest new tech.  The saying, "Work smarter not harder." is applicable even in our daily personal routine.
